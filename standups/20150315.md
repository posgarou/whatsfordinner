# What did you do yesterday?

I lost a great deal of time yesterday due to an error where I was getting SegmentationFaults whenever I tried to run any command using the Rails environment (`$ rails`, `$ rack`) etc.  I later tracked it down to an (evidently known bug) where the gem the_ruby_racer can be erroneously installed by Bundler with the jruby version rather than the ruby version.  By adding `gem 'therubyracer', platforms: :ruby` to my Gemfile, emptying the gemset, and reinstalling all gems, I fixed the segmentation fault.

Yesterday I planned on working to flesh out the API endpoints.  I realized, though, that while I knew how to do that (and could do it quickly), I didn't know how to handle Neo4j relations.

I spent the day working on:

1. Storing properties for Neo4j ActiveRel objects.
2. Experimenting with the interaction between ActiveNode and ActiveRel objects.
3. Writing effective tests for ActiveRel objects.

As a result, I wrote the functionality to generate and scale a quantified list of ingredients (1 egg, 1 cup sugar, 2 15 oz steaks, etc.).

# What are you going to do today?

* Write the functionality to store recipe steps
* Finally write some Grape API endpoints.

# What's in your way?

Not very much.  I understand the technologies I'll be using today and am looking forward to getting my API up and running.
