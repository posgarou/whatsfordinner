# What did you do yesterday?

What I set out to do yesterday.  I implemented recipe steps with tests, presentation functionality, etc.  I also developed some basic Grape Entities to present my data cleanly and effectively to the API.

# What are you going to do today?

* Work on a User/Recipe history
* Correspondingly, work on a UserRecipeHistory facade that will be used both as such on the Dashboard and (in part) on recipe views.
* If I have time, I would love to start working on some frontend controllers and views, since I need to get rolling on that to have an MVP by Wednesday.

# What's in my way?

 Coding-wise, not very much.  Facades are simple to implement.  It will take some time to work out a good preliminary UserRecipe history, and it will involve working with Neo4j::ActiveRel, which I find to be a difficult DSL to work with effectively.

 Personally, I've been developing a headache as the day goes on that is making it difficult to think through these problems clearly.
